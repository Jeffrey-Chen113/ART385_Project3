# ART385_Project3
##By: Jeffrey Chen

This program will display a HUD used to track the inputs of an Ardunio simulating a gaming peripheral that I designed. The gaming peripheral will replicated one half of a standard game controller and this project will use basic input devices from class to replicate those controls while still pertaining to the imaginary device.
